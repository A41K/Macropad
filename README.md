# The Challenges
Honestly, the real challenge was learning Fusion360 (never used it before) and learning KiCad again. The most pain I had was with the wiring in
KiCad and the making of the top part of the Pad. These both took me atleast an hour, but the explanations really helped me to understand
what my problems were and how to fix them
